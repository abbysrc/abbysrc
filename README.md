## Hiya, I'm Hannah, aka `hanatic` or (occasionally) Mama Smurf

#### Languages I know:
- Java
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Kotlin (haven't used it in a while but I know how it works)
- Python (I suppose)

#### Right now:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the core engine for Gemstone Network.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on basically anything, especially Discord or Minecraft-related projects!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **learning how the fuck BungeeCord plugin channels work**

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/they/xe or basically anything except he/him

#### Outside of the development world:
- I'm a guitarist, pianist and bassist (ans I sing sometimes)
- I play video games (usually Minecraft, Mini Motorways or Cities: Skylines)
- I do a bit of editing, but not much as I don't have the right equipment
