### Hiya, I'm Abby, and I break other people's code at 2am then get yelled at by the project's maintainers 💅
_Don't believe me? [See for yourself](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldGuard/pull/1917)..._

📜 I'm currently working at **@Planetry**.<br>
🏛️ I'm experienced with **Java, TypeScript and JavaScript**.<br>
📋 I'm currently learning about **GLSL and Minecraft's shader engine**.<br>
🌍 Outside of programming, I do **pixel art and I play the guitar, bass and piano**.<br>
